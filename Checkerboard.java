	// Define a constructor that initalizes x, y and width, but sets
	// squaresPerSide, evenColor and oddColor to default values
	
	// Define a constructor that initializes all of the instance fields
	
	// Define a set method that sets BOTH the x and y fields.
	
	// Define a get and set (accessor and mutator) method for the width
	
	// Define a get and set (accessor and mutator) method for squaresPerSide
	
	// Define a set (mutator) method for evenColor
	
	// Define a set (mutator) method for oddColor
	
	// Define a toString method that returns information about this object
	
	// BONUS: Define a draw method that draws the checkerboard
